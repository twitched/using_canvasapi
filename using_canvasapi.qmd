## The Canvas API

One important feature of Canvas is its [API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/). In fact, the Canvas LMS as we use it is built on its API. Everything a user does in either Canvas' web interface or the mobile apps goes through the API. This architecture allows every user to use the API to do anything they could do in the browser or mobile app plus more in a program.

This guide shows how to use Python and a library created by the University of Central Florida to create scripts that use the API.

## Getting Started

### Getting an Access Token

To get direct access to the API you need an access token that acts like a password. You can get the key from your user. As shown below, go to your users settings and click on `New Access Token`.

![Getting an access token](images/get_token.png)

The `Purpose` field can have anything you want, but it is good to choose something that will help you remember why you created it. If you are doing this for learning, I suggest "Learning the Canvas API".

`Expiration`: You should have your token expire in case you don't use it again. If you are doing this for learning, have the token expire soon. You can create another at anytime. You can create more than one at a time if you want.

::: callout-warning
This access token is just as good as your username and password. Plus, it doesn't require Duo! Treat it with extreme caution. Anyone with it can log into Canvas as you.
:::

Copy the token to a safe place like a password manager or a temporary document on your desktop so that you can delete it later. As the dialog says, it will only show it one time. If you close the dialog before copying the token or copy it incorrectly. Delete that token (ðŸ—‘) and create another.

### Install Python

If you already have Python 3.9 or greater installed, and you can run python from the command line, you can skip this section.

::: callout-note
These instructions are for Windows. If you are using MacOS or Linux, I suggest using your favorite package manager (like `brew` for MacOS) to install Python.
:::

If not, do the following:

-   Go to <https://python.org>, go to Downloads and choose to download the `Latest Python 3 Release`. At the time of this writing, the latest is 3.10.8. It might be higher now.
-   Double click on the installer file to start the install
-   **Check the box that says `Add python.exe to PATH`**
-   Choose `Install Now` to complete the rest of the install

Check to see if it worked by

-   **Right**-clicking on the start menu button and choosing `Windows PowerShell`
-   At the prompt type `python --version` and press enter

It should show the version of python. This shows that you installed correctly. If it doesn't work, uninstall python and reinstall it making sure you follow the instructions above.

::: callout-note
Since we will be doing a lot on the command line I suggest installing and using [the Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701). It does a lot of things better than the standard command line through Powershell or cmd.
:::

### Install Needed Packages

Now that Python is installed and we can run it from the command line, we are ready to install the Python packages we need to use the Canvas API.

-   Open the command line (either Windows Terminal, if you installed it, or Windows PowerShell)
-   Enter the following:

```{powershell}
pip install canvasapi keyring
```

### Store your API token securely

We can use the `keyring` package we just installed to store your Canvas API token securely and where we can retrieve it later:

```{powershell}
keyring set canvas token
```
